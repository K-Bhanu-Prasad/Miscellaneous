/**
 * In English and programming, groups can be made using symbols such as () and {}
 * that change meaning. However, these groups must be closed in the correct order
 * to maintain correct syntax.
 * Your job will be to make a program that checks a string for correct grouping.
 * For instance, the following groups are done correctly:
 *
		 ({})
		[[]()]
		[{()}]

		The next are done incorrectly:

		{(})
		([]
		[])
